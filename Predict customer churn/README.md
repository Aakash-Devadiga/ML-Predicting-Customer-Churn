# Predict Customer Churn

- Project **Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity

## Project Description
The Project is aimed at identifying credit card customers who are most likely to churn.
Machine learning algorithms have been used to achieve this objective. PEP8 standard has been followed while writing the Python code.
Python Codes could be found in the repository along with the testing and logging python script.


## Running Files
All the requirements could be checked in the requirements.txt file

All the functions are in the **churn_library.py**
This file could be ran to obtain the results after which **churn_script_logging_and_tests.py** could be used to have the logs which would be saved seperately in the log file in the logging folder.
All the results are saved in the results folder in jpg. format within the Images folder.

below mentioned line of code should produce the .log file with the result from running all tests :
```
ipython churn_script_logging_and_tests_solution.py
```

Result of tests/logs are available in logs folder. 
Images folder will container the output results.
